	Abstract = {The widespread adoption of mobile phones has brought an increasing interest in the development of mobile applications for higher education. In this paper we examine the use of mobile applications in university education, focusing on Kenya, a leading country in mobile services. The main goal is to investigate if university students are using or would like to use mobile phones and apps, in particular educational apps. Information gathered from the study gives an insight on which apps to adopt or implement in university education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{visuallyImpaired,
	Abstract = {Introduction: The literature indicates that few studies have been conducted with persons with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) concerning mobile application or "app" usage. The current study explores the use of mobile apps with this population globally. Methods: A total of 259 participants with visual impairments completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests were used to examine associations between demographic characteristics and mobile app use. Results: The participants rated special apps as useful (95.4%) and accessible (91.1%) tools for individuals with visual impairments. More than 90% of the middle-aged adult group strongly agreed with the practicality of special apps, a significantly higher percentage than was observed in the young and old adult groups. In addition, the participants with low vision considered special apps less accessible than did those with blindness (p < .05). Discussion: Results show that persons wi},

@article{privacy,
	Abstract = {In a world where the industry of mobile applications is continuously expanding and new health care apps and devices are created every day, it is important to take special care of the collection and treatment of users' personal health information. However, the appropriate methods to do this are not usually taken into account by apps designers and insecure applications are released. This paper presents a study of security and privacy in mHealth, focusing on three parts: a study of the existing laws regulating these aspects in the European Union and the United States, a review of the academic literature related to this topic, and a proposal of some recommendations for designers in order to create mobile health applications that satisfy the current security and privacy legislation. This paper will complement other standards and certifications about security and privacy and will suppose a quick guide for apps designers, developers and researchers.; },
